# Eyes in the sky on Tigray - Monitoring the impact of armed conflict on cultivated land using satellite imagery in Ethiopia.

This repo contains codes to create maps of spatial distribution of estimated change in well-cultivation status from 2019/20 to 2021 at 10m resolution (A), 
estimated net (gain minus loss) cultivated cropland from 2019/20 to 2021 using 10x10km grid (B) as derived from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and the causal effect of conflict incidence on well-cultivated land in Tigray, Ethiopia.

## Map creation
[Here](https://code.earthengine.google.com/13184712cee613629ef02a76027d7d5a) is the Google Earth Engine script used to visualize change in well-cultivation maps.
